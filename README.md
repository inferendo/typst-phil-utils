Compilation of Typst technical writing utilities for philosophy and adjacent matters

## Sentence Figure
Sometimes philosophers will define or bring up a specific sentence when writing, the sentence is often numbered with brackets so as to refer to it later in the text. This Typst script adds utility functions to produce and index these sentences, which I call "sentence figures". This code was developed partially with a LLM.
